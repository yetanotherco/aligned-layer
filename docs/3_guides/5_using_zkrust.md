# Generating & submitting proofs to Aligned using zkRust

[zkRust](https://github.com/yetanotherco/zkRust) is a CLI tool to generate proofs of your rust code using a RISCV-zkVM's and submit them to Aligned to be verified with only one command.
The following provers are supported:

- [Risc0](https://github.com/risc0/risc0)
- [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1)

## Dependencies

To generate and submit proofs to Aligned using ZKRust, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (**Optional**, needed only to create a local
  keystore to sign Ethereum transactions if you didn't already have one).

## Generate & Submit proofs

To generate and submit proofs to Aligned testnet using zkRust, you can follow the steps below:

### 1. Install zkRust :

The zkRust executable can be installed directly via the command line via:

```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetanotherco/zkRust/main/install_zkrust.sh | bash
```

or built by cloning the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yetanotherco/zkRust
cd zkRust
```

and running the installation script:

```sh
make install
```

### 2. Generate a keystore:

You can use cast to create a local keystore.
If you already have one, you can skip this step.

```bash
cast wallet new-mnemonic
```

Then you can import your created keystore using:

```bash
cast wallet import --interactive <path_to_keystore.json>
```

Make sure to send at least 0.1 Holesky ETH to the address in the keystore.
You can get Holesky ETH from the [faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky)

### 3. Generate and submit the proof with zkRust:

The zkRust repo has some predefined examples that can be used to generate a proof.
You can find them in `zkRust/examples`.
For example, to generate a proof of a `fibonacci` program with Risc0 or SP1 and submit it to aligned, run:

```sh
cargo run --release --  prove-risc0 \
    --submit-to-aligned-with-keystore \
    <PATH_TO_KEYSTORE> \
    examples/fibonacci .
```

This command will generate a proof for the fibonacci example program and submit it to Aligned using the keystore
provided for signing the transaction.

Take into consideration that the proof generation can take some time.
Once the proof has been generated, a prompt will appear asking for the passphrase of your keystore and then send it to
Aligned.

The same program can be proved using SP1 just changing the zkRust subcommand:

```bash
cargo run --release -- prove-sp1 \
    --submit-to-aligned-with-keystore <path_to_keystore> \
    examples/fibonacci .
```

## Caveats

For the moment, the Rust code that can be proven has some limitations:

- Programs with user Input and Output to the vm code are not supported.
