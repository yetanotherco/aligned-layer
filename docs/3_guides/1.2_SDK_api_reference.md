# Aligned SDK

## API Reference

### `submit`

Submits a proof to the batcher to be verified and returns an aligned verification data struct.

```rust
pub async fn submit(
    batcher_url: &str,
    chain: Chain,
    verification_data: &VerificationData,
    max_fee; U256,
    wallet: Wallet<SigningKey>,
    nonce: U256,
) -> Result<AlignedVerificationData, errors::SubmitError>
