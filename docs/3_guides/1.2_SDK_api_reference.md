# Aligned SDK

## API Reference

### `submit`

Submits a proof to the batcher to be verified and returns an aligned verification data struct.

```rust
pub async fn submit(
    batcher_url: &str,
    network: Network,
    verification_data: &VerificationData,
    max_fee; U256,
    wallet: Wallet<SigningKey>,
    nonce: U256,
) -> Result<AlignedVerificationData, errors::SubmitError>
```

#### Arguments

- `batcher_url` - The url of the batcher to which the proof will be submitted.
- `network` - The network on which the proof will be submitted (`devnet | holesky-stage | holesky`)
- `verification_data` - The verification data for the proof.
- `max_fee` - The maximum fee that the submitter is willing to pay for the proof verification.
- `wallet` - The wallet used to sign the proof. Should be using correct chain id. See `get_chain_id`.
- `nonce` - The nonce of the submitter address. See `get_next_nonce`.

#### Returns

- `Result<AlignedVerificationData, SubmitError>` - An aligned verification data or an error.

#### Errors

- `MissingRequiredParameter` if the verification data vector is empty.
- `ProtocolVersionMismatch` if the version of the SDK is lower than the expected one.
- `UnexpectedBatcherResponse` if the batcher doesn't respond with the expected message.
- `SerializationError` if there is an error deserializing the message sent from the batcher.
- `WebSocketConnectionError` if there is an error connecting to the batcher.
- `WebSocketClosedUnexpectedlyError` if the connection with the batcher is closed unexpectedly.
- `InvalidSignature` if the signature is invalid.
- `InvalidNonce` if the nonce is invalid.
- `InvalidMaxFee` if the max fee is invalid.
- `InvalidProof` if the proof is invalid.
- `ProofTooLarge` if the proof is too large.
- `InsufficientBalance` if the sender balance is not enough or unlocked
- `ProofQueueFlushed` if there is an error in the batcher and the proof queue is flushed.
- `NotAContract(address)` if you are trying to send to an address that is not a contract. This generally occurs if you have misconfigured the `environment` parameter.
- `GenericError` if the error doesn't match any of the previous ones.
