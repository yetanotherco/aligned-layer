## Local Devnet Setup

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [zap-pretty](https://github.com/maoueh/zap-pretty)
- [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/abigen)
- [eigenlayer-cli](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli.git)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

To install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) go to the provided links and follow the instructions.

Install Go dependencies ([zap-pretty](https://github.com/maoueh/zap-pretty), [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/abigen), [eigenlayer-cli](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli.git)):

```bash
make go_deps
```

Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation):

```bash
make install_foundry
foundryup
```

Install necessary submodules and build all the FFIs for your OS:

```bash
make deps
```

If you want to rebuild the FFIs you can use:

```bash
make build_all_ffi
```

### Booting Devnet with Default configs

Before starting you need to setup an S3 bucket. More data storage will be tested in the future.

You need to fill the data in:

```batcher/aligned-batcher/.env```

And you can use this file as an example on how to fill it:

```batcher/aligned-batcher/.env.example```

After having the env setup, run in different terminals the following commands to boot Aligned locally:

```bash
make anvil_start_with_block_time
```

```bash
make aggregator_start
```

```bash
make operator_register_and_start
```

```bash
make batcher_start
```

If you need to start again the operator, and it's already registered, use:

```bash
make operator_start
```

If you want to start the explorer for the devnet, see how to run it using it's [documentation](#explorer) below.

### Send test proofs to batcher for testing

All these proofs are for testing purposes

Send 8 proofs each second:

```bash
make batcher_send_burst_groth16
```

Send Groth 16 proofs each 2 seconds:

```bash
make batcher_send_infinite_groth16
```

Send an individual Groth 16 proof:

```bash
make batcher_send_groth16_task
```

To send an individual test SP1 proof:

```bash
make batcher_send_sp1_task
```

### Detailed Testnet Deployment

#### Changing operator keys

Operator keys can be changed if needed.

To create a keystore, run:

```bash
cast wallet new-mnemonic
cast wallet import <keystore-name> --private-key <private-key>
```

To create an ECDSA keystore, run:

```bash
eigenlayer operator keys import --key-type ecdsa <keystore-name> <private-key>
```

To create a BLS keystore, run:

```bash
eigenlayer operator keys import --key-type bls <keystore-name> <private-key>
```

#### Aggregator

If you want to run the aggregator with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make aggregator_start
```

To start the aggregator with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make aggregator_start CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

#### Operator

Operator needs to register in both EigenLayer and Aligned. Then it can start verifying proofs.

##### Register into EigenLayer

To register an operator in EigenLayer Devnet with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_eigen_layer
```

To register an operator in EigenLayer with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_eigen_layer CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

##### Register into Aligned

To register an operator in Aligned with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_aligned_layer
```

To register an operator in Aligned with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_aligned_layer CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

##### Full Registration in Anvil with one command

To register an operator in EigenLayer and Aligned and deposit strategy tokens in EigenLayer with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_full_registration
```

To register an operator in EigenLayer and Aligned and deposit strategy tokens in EigenLayer with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_full_registration CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

##### Deposit Strategy Tokens in Anvil local devnet

There is an ERC20 token deployed in the Anvil chain to use as strategy token with EigenLayer.

To deposit strategy tokens in the Anvil chain with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_mint_mock_tokens
make operator_deposit_into_mock_strategy
```

To deposit strategy tokens in the Anvil chain with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_mint_mock_tokens CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
make operator_deposit_into_mock_strategy CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

#### Deposit Strategy tokens in Holesky/Mainnet

EigenLayer strategies are available in [eigenlayer-strategies](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/restake).

For Holesky, we are using [WETH](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/restake/WETH) as the strategy token.

To obtain HolETH and swap it for different strategies, you can use the following [guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/testnet/obtaining-testnet-eth-and-liquid-staking-tokens-lsts).

#### Config

There is a default configuration for devnet purposes in `config-files/config.yaml`.
Also, there are 3 different configurations for the operator in `config-files/devnet/operator-1.yaml`, `config-files/devnet/operator-2.yaml` and `config-files/devnet/operator-3.yaml`.

The configuration file has the following structure:

```yaml
# Common variables for all the services
# 'production' only prints info and above. 'development' also prints debug
environment: <production/development>
aligned_layer_deployment_config_file_path: <path_to_aligned_layer_deployment_config_file>
eigen_layer_deployment_config_file_path: <path_to_eigen_layer_deployment_config_file>

```

#### Run

If you want to run the operator with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_start
```

To start the operator with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_start CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

### Batcher

#### Batcher Config

To run the batcher, you will need to set environment variables in a `.env` file in the same directory as the batcher (`batcher/aligned-batcher/`).

The necessary environment variables are:

| Variable Name         | Description                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Secret key to authenticate and authorize API requests to the AWS S3 Bucket.                                                    |
| AWS_REGION            | Geographical region where the AWS S3 Bucket will be accessed.                                                                  |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | Access key used in combination with the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to authenticate and authorize API requests to the AWS S3 Bucket. |
| AWS_BUCKET_NAME       | Name of the AWS S3 Bucket.                                                                                                     |
| RUST_LOG              | Rust log level (info, debug, error, warn, etc.).                                                                               |

You can find an example `.env` file in [.env.example](../../batcher/aligned-batcher/.env.example)

You can configure the batcher in `config-files/config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Common variables for all the services
eth_rpc_url: <http_rpc_url>
eth_ws_url: <ws_rpc_url>
aligned_layer_deployment_config_file_path: <path_to_aligned_layer_deployment_config_file>

## Batcher Configurations
batcher:
  block_interval: <block_interval>
  batch_size_interval: <batch_size_interval>

## ECDSA Configurations
ecdsa:
  private_key_store_path: <path_to_ecdsa_private_key_store>
  private_key_store_password: <ecdsa_private_key_store_password>
```

#### Run

```bash
make batcher_start
```

### Send tasks

#### Sending a Task to the Batcher using our Rust TaskSender CLI

#### Send one SP1 proof

```bash
make batcher_send_sp1_task
```

#### Send one Groth 16 proof

```bash
make batcher_send_groth16_bn254_task
```

#### Send infinite Groth 16 proofs

```bash
make batcher_send_infinite_groth16
```

#### Send burst of Groth 16 proofs

```bash
make batcher_send_burst_groth16
```

#### Send specific proof

To install the batcher client to send a specific proof, run:

```bash
make install_batcher_client
```

The SP1 and Risc0 proofs need the proof file and the vm program file. The current SP1 version used in Aligned is v1.0.8-testnet and the current Risc0 version used in Aligned is v1.0.1.
The GnarkPlonkBn254, GnarkPlonkBls12_381 and Groth16Bn254 proofs need the proof file, the public input file and the verification key file.

```bash
aligned \
--proving_system <SP1|GnarkPlonkBn254|GnarkPlonkBls12_381|Groth16Bn254|Risc0> \
--proof <proof_file> \
--public-input <public_input_file> \
--vm_program <vm_program_file> \
--proof_generator_addr [proof_generator_addr] \
--aligned_verification_data_path [aligned_verification_data_path]
```

## Deploying Aligned Contracts to Holesky or Testnet

### Eigenlayer Contracts: Anvil

If EigenLayer contracts change, the anvil state needs to be updated with:

```bash
make anvil_deploy_eigen_contracts
```

You will also need to redeploy the MockStrategy & MockERC20 contracts:

```bash
make anvil_deploy_mock_strategy
```

### Eigenlayer Contracts: Holesky/Mainnet

These contracts are not deployed by Aligned. Current EigenLayer contracts:

- [Holesky Contracts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/testnet-holesky/script/configs/holesky/Holesky_current_deployment.config.json)
- [Mainnet Contracts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/mainnet/script/configs/mainnet/Mainnet_current_deployment.config.json)

### Aligned Contracts: Anvil

When changing Aligned contracts, the anvil state needs to be updated with:

```bash
make anvil_deploy_aligned_contracts
```

To test the upgrade script for ServiceManager in the local devnet, run:

```bash
make anvil_upgrade_aligned_contracts
```

To test the upgrade script for RegistryCoordintator in the local devnet, run:

```bash
make anvil_upgrade_registry_coordinator
```

#### Aligned Contracts: Holesky/Mainnet

To deploy the contracts to Testnet/Mainnet, you will need to set environment variables in a `.env` file in the same directory as the deployment script (`contracts/scripts/`).

The necessary environment variables are:

| Variable Name                   | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RPC_URL`                       | The RPC URL of the network you want to deploy to.                     |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`                   | The private key of the account you want to deploy the contracts with. |
| `EXISTING_DEPLOYMENT_INFO_PATH` | The path to the file containing the deployment info about EigenLayer. |
| `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH`            | The path to the deployment config file.                               |
| `OUTPUT_PATH`                   | The path to the file where the deployment info will be saved.         |

You can find an example `.env` file in [.env.example.holesky](../../contracts/scripts/.env.example.holesky)

Then run the following command:

```bash
make deploy_aligned_contracts
```

You need to complete the `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH` file with the following information:

```json
{
    "chainInfo": {
      "chainId": "<chain_id>"
    },
    "permissions" : {
      "owner": "<owner_address>",
      "aggregator": "<aggregator_address>",
      "upgrader": "<upgrader_address>",
      "churner": "<churner_address>",
      "ejector": "<ejector_address>",
      "deployer": "<deployer_address>",
      "initalPausedStatus": 0
    },
    "minimumStakes": [],  
    "strategyWeights": [],
    "operatorSetParams": [],
    "uri": ""
  }
```

You can find an example config file in `contracts/script/deploy/config/holesky/aligned.holesky.config.json`.

To upgrade the Service Manager Contract in Testnet/Mainnet, run:

```bash
make upgrade_aligned_contracts
```

To upgrade the Registry Coordinator in Testnet/Mainnet, run:

```bash
make upgrade_registry_coordinator
```

Make sure to set environment variables in a `.env` file in the same directory as the upgrade script (`contracts/scripts/`).

### Bindings

Also make sure to re-generate the Go smart contract bindings:

```bash
make bindings
```

### Deployment

To build go binaries run:

```bash
make build_binaries
```

## Metrics

### Aggregator Metrics

Aggregator metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint.

If you are using the default config, you can access the metrics on `http://localhost:9091/metrics`.

To run Prometheus and Grafana just run:

```bash
make run_metrics
```

Then you can access Grafana on `http://localhost:3000` with the default credentials `admin:admin`.

If you want to install Prometheus and Grafana manually, you can follow the instructions below.

To install Prometheus, you can follow the instructions on the [official website](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).

To install Grafana, you can follow the instructions on the [official website](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/).

## Explorer

### Minimum Requirements

- [Erlang 26](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang)
- [Elixir 1.16.2](https://elixir-ko.github.io/install.html), compiled with OTP 26
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### DB Setup

To setup the explorer, an installation of the DB is needed.

First you'll need to install docker if you don't have it already. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

The explorer uses a PostgreSQL database. To build and start the DB using docker, just run:

```bash
make build_db
```

This will build the docker image to be used as our database.

After this, both `make run_explorer` and `make run_devnet_explorer` (see [this](#running-for-local-devnet) for more details) will automatically start, setup and connect to the database, which will be available on `localhost:5432` and the data is persisted in a volume.

<details>

<summary>
  (Optional) The steps to manually execute the database are as follows...
</summary>

- Run the database container, opening port `5432`:

```bash
make run_db
```

- Configure the database with ecto running `ecto.create` and `ecto.migrate`:

```bash
make ecto_setup_db
```

- Start the explorer:

```bash
make run_explorer # or make run_devnet_explorer
```

</details>

<br>

In order to clear the DB, you can run:

```bash
make clean_db
```

If you need to dumb the data from the DB, you can run:

```bash
make dump_db
```

This will create a `dump.$date.sql` SQL script on the `explorer` directory with all the existing data.

Data can be recovered from a `dump.$date.sql` using the following command:

```bash
make recover_db
```

Then you'll be requested to enter the file name of the dump you want to recover already positioned in the `/explorer` directory.

This will update your database with the dumped database data.

### Extra scripts

If you want to fetch past batches that for any reason were not inserted into the DB, you will first need to make sure you have the ELIXIR_HOSTNAME .env variable configured. You can get the hostname of your elixir by running `elixir -e 'IO.puts(:inet.gethostname() |> elem(1))'`

Then you can run:

```bash
make explorer_fetch_old_batches
```

You can modify which blocks are being fetched by modify the parameters the `explorer_fetch_old_batches.sh` is being recieved

### Running for local devnet

To run the explorer for the local devnet, you'll need to have the devnet running (see [local devnet setup](#local-devnet-setup)) and the DB already setup.

To run the explorer, just run:

```bash
make run_devnet_explorer
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
You can access to a tasks information by visiting `localhost:4000/batches/:merkle_root`.

### Run with custom env / other devnets

Create a `.env` file in the `/explorer` directory of the project. The `.env` file needs to contain the following variables:

| Variable              | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RPC_URL`             | The RPC URL of the network you want to connect to.                                                 |
| `ENVIRONMENT`         | The environment you want to run the application in. It can be `devnet`, `holesky` or `mainnet`.    |
| `ALIGNED_CONFIG_FILE` | The config file containing Aligned contracts' deployment information                               |
| `PHX_HOST`            | The host URL where the Phoenix server will be running.                                             |
| `DB_NAME`             | The name of the postgres database.                                                                 |
| `DB_USER`             | The username of the postgres database.                                                             |
| `DB_PASS`             | The password of the postgres database.                                                             |
| `DB_HOST`             | The host URL where the postgres database will be running.                                          |
| `ELIXIR_HOSTNAME`     | The hostname of your running elixir. Read [Extra Scripts](#extra-scripts) section for more details |

Then you can run the explorer with this env file config by entering the following command:

```make run_explorer```

### Send example data

If you want to have some data to see on it, you can start our infinite task sender, which will constantly send new proofs to the batcher.

```sh
make batcher_send_burst_groth16
```

## Notes on project creation

Eigenlayer middleware was installed as a submodule with:

```sh
mkdir contracts
cd contacts
forge init . --no-commit
forge install Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware@mainnet
```

Then to solve the issue <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/issues/229>, we changed it to:

```forge install yetanotherco/eigenlayer-middleware@yac-mainnet --no-commit```

As soon as it gets fixed in mainnet we can revert it.

Base version of middleware used is ```7229f2b```.

The script to initialize the devnet can be found on  ```contracts/scripts/anvil```.

The addresses of the relevant contracts after running the anvil script is dumped on ```contracts/script/output/devnet```.

The state is backuped on ```contracts/scripts/anvil/state```.

Eigenlayer contract deployment is almost the same as the EigenLayer contract deployment on mainnet. Changes are described on the file.

## Tests

To run the go tests

```bash
make test
```
