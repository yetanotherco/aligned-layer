# Generating Proofs For Aligned

## SP1

### Dependencies

This guide assumes that:

- sp1 prover installed (instructions [here](https://succinctlabs.github.io/sp1/getting-started/install.html))
- sp1 project to generate the proofs
  (instructions [here](https://succinctlabs.github.io/sp1/generating-proofs/setup.html))
- aligned installed (instructions [here](../introduction/1_getting_started.md#quickstart))

### How to generate a proof

> Aligned only verifies SP1 in a compressed version.
> You can check you are using compressed by opening script/src/main.rs
> and check that the proof is generated with `client.prove_compressed` instead of `client.prove`.

First, open a terminal and navigate to the script folder in the sp1 project directory

Then, run the following command to generate a proof:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### How to get the proof verified by Aligned

After generating the proof, you will have to find two different files:

- **proof file**: usually found under `script` directory, with the name `proof.json` or similar
- **elf file**: usually found under `program/elf/` directory

Then, you can send the proof to the Aligned network by running the following command

```bash
aligned submit \
--proving_system SP1 \
--proof <proof_path> \
--vm_program <vm_program_path> \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com \
--proof_generator_addr <proof_generator_addr\
--rpc https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com \
--batcher_addr 0x815aeCA64a974297942D2Bbf034ABEe22a38A003``

Where `proof_path` is the path to the proof file and vm program path is the path to the elf file.

For more instructions on how to submit proofs, check the [Submitting proofs guide](../guides/0_submitting_proofs.md).

## Gnark

### Dependencies

This guide assumes that:

- Gnark library is installed. If not, install it using the following command inside your Go module:

 ```bash
 go get github.com/consensys/gnark@v0.10.0
 ```

- Gnark project to generate the proofs' instructions [here](https://docs.gnark.consensys.io/category/how-to)

### How to generate a proof

Open a terminal and navigate to the Gnark project directory. Then, run the following command to generate the proof:

 ```bash
 go run circuit.go
 ```

### How to get the proof verified by Aligned

After generating the proof, you will have to have three different files:

- proof file
- verification key file
- public input file

For a detailed guide on how to generate those files, refer to our [detailed guide](3.2_generate_gnark_proof.md).

Then, you can send the proof to the Aligned network by running the following command

```bash
aligned submit \
--proving_system GnarkPlonkBn254 \
--proof <proof_path> \
--public_input <public_input_path>
--vk <verification_key_path> \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com \
--proof_generator_addr <proof_generator_addr> \
--rpc https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com \
--batcher_addr 0x815aeCA64a974297942D2Bbf034ABEe22a38A003
```

Where proof path is the path to the proof file, `public_input_path` is the path to the public input file,
and `verification_key_path` is the path to the verification key file.

## Risc0

### Dependencies

This guide assumes that:

- Risc0 toolchain installed (instructions [here](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/quickstart#1-install-the-risc-zero-toolchain))
- Risc0 project to generate the proofs (instructions [here](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/quickstart#2-create-a-new-project))
- Aligned installed (instructions [here](../introduction/1_getting_started.md#quickstart))

### How to generate a proof

First, open the risc0 host file and add the following code to export image id & public input needed by Aligned.

```rust
fn main() {
    // your code here

    // <METHOD_ID> is the method id of the function you want to prove
    // <method_id_file_path> is the path where the method id will be saved
    std::fs::write("<method_id_file_path>", convert(&<METHOD_ID>))
            .expect("Failed to write method_id file");

    // <pub_input_file_path> is the path where the public input will be saved
    std::fs::write("<pub_input_file_path>", receipt.journal.bytes)
            .expect("Failed to write pub_input file");
}


// Convert u32 array to u8 array for storage
pub fn convert(data: &[u32; 8]) -> [u8; 32] {
    let mut res = [0; 32];
    for i in 0..8 {
        res[4 * i..4 * (i + 1)].copy_from_slice(&data[i].to_le_bytes());
    }
    res
}
```

Note that METHOD_ID will be imported from guest, but it will be under a different name.

Then run the following command to generate the proof:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### How to get the proof verified by Aligned

After generating the proof, you will have to find three different files:

- Proof file
- Image id file
- Public input file

Then, you can send the proof to the Aligned network by running the following command

```bash
aligned submit \
  --proving_system Risc0 \
  --proof <proof_file_path> \
  --vm_program <method_id_file_path> \
  --public_input <pub_input_file_path> \
  --conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com \
  --proof_generator_addr <proof_generator_addr> \
  --rpc https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com \
  --batcher_addr 0x815aeCA64a974297942D2Bbf034ABEe22a38A003
```
