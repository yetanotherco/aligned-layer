## Approve the Pause for AlignedLayerServiceManager

1. Go to [Safe](https://app.safe.global/home) and connect your wallet.

2. Go to the `Transactions` tab and find the transaction that was proposed.

3. Get the ```modifyStrategyParams()()``` signature by running:
   
   ```bash
   cast calldata "modifyStrategyParams(uint8,uint256[],uint96[])()" <quorum_number> <[strategyIndices]> <[newMultipliers]>
   ```

   for example:

   ```bash
   cast calldata "modifyStrategyParams(uint8,uint256[],uint96[])()" 0 "[0]" "[123456]"
   ```
   
   It must show you ```0x20b66298...```.
   
4. Click on the transaction, and then click on ```Advanced Details```.
