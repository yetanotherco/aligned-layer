# Deployment of Aligned Contracts

This guide will walk you through the deployment of the Aligned Layer contracts.

    After finishing the setup of the multisig, you will have a multisig address.

2. To deploy the contracts, you can follow the [Deployment Guide](./2_deploy_contracts.md).

    After finishing the deployment, you will have the deployed contract addresses.

3. Once you have deployed the Aligned contracts, you can perform upgrades on them.
