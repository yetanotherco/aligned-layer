# Deployment of Aligned Contracts

This guide will walk you through the deployment of the Aligned Layer contracts.

  
## Setup

1. If you want to manage AlignedLayer contracts (like upgrades or pauses) using a Multisig wallet, you can follow the [Multisig Wallet Creation Guide](./1_multisig_creation.md).

    After finishing the setup of the multisig, you will have a multisig address.

2. To deploy the contracts, you can follow the [Deployment Guide](./2_deploy_contracts.md).

    After finishing the deployment, you will have the deployed contract addresses.

3. Once you have deployed the Aligned contracts, you can perform upgrades on them.

    a. If you are not using a Multisig wallet, you can follow the [Upgrade Guide](./3_a_upgrade_contracts.md).
    
    b. If you are using a Multisig wallet, you can follow the [Upgrade Guide with Multisig](./3_b_upgrade_contracts_with_multisig.md).
