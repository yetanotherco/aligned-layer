# Pause Contracts with a Multisig

> [!WARNING]  
> Safe Multisig Wallet is not currently supported in Holesky Testnet.
> For this reason, we deployed EigenLayer contracts in Sepolia to test the upgrade on AlignedLayer Contracts.

> [!NOTE]
> EigenLayer Sepolia contracts information is available in `contracts/script/output/sepolia/eigenlayer_deployment_output.json`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can find a guide on how to Deploy the contracts [here](./2_deploy_contracts.md).

This guide is for pausing contracts deployed using a Multisig wallet. If you deployed the contract without a Multisig wallet, you can follow the [Pause Contracts](./4_a_pause_contracts.md) tutorial.

In this guide we pause and unpause the AlignedLayerServiceManager and BatcherPaymentService contracts using a multisig wallet.
