# Propose the Transaction for Upgrade using Multisig

After deploying a new implementation candidate for the upgrade, you need to propose the upgrade transaction using the multisig wallet.

## Propose transaction for AlignedLayerServiceManager

To propose the upgrade transaction you can follow the steps below:

1. Go to [Safe](https://app.safe.global/home)

2. Click on `New transaction` -> `Transaction Builder`

4. Get the `alignedLayerProxyAdmin` address from ```contracts/script/output/mainnet/alignedlayer_deployment_output.json``` or ```contracts/script/output/holesky/alignedlayer_deployment_output.json``` or ```contracts/script/output/sepolia/alignedlayer_deployment_output.json```, and paste it on `Enter Address or ENS Name`

5. Once you paste the address, the ABI should be automatically filled.

6. Choose the method ```upgrade``` in ```Contract method selector```.

7. Get the ```alignedLayerServiceManager``` and ```alignedServiceManagerImplementation``` address from ```contracts/script/output/mainnet/alignedlayer_deployment_output.json``` or ```contracts/script/output/holesky/alignedlayer_deployment_output.json``` or ```contracts/script/output/sepolia/alignedlayer_deployment_output.json```.

8. Paste ```alignedLayerServiceManager``` address in ```proxy (address)```

9. Paste ```alignedServiceManagerImplementation``` address in ```implementation (address)```

10. Click on `Create batch` to create the transaction.

11. Review and confirm the transaction.
   
      To make sure everything is fine, simulate the transaction by clicking on `Simulate batch`
   
      Once the simulation is successful, click on `Send Batch` to send the transaction.

12. Confirm the transaction checking the function being called is correct and the contract address is the one you deployed.

      If everything is correct, click on `Sign` to send the transaction.

      ![Confirm transaction](./images/3_b_2_multisig_9.png)

13. Now in your transactions, you should be able to see the newly created transaction.

14. If the transaction is correctly created, you have to wait until the required Multisig member signs the transaction to send it.
