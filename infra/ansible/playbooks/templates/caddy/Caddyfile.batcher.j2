# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.

# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

# Refer to the Caddy docs for more information:
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile
